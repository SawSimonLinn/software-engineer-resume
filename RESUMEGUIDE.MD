# Simon’s Resume Tips Guide

These are my personal tips for writing a strong one-page resume — especially if you’re a junior developer or early in your career.

---

## Keep It One Page

Recruiters spend seconds on a resume, not minutes.  
Focus on what matters most and make every line count.

If you’re a **junior developer**, your goal is to show skill, growth, and potential — not everything you’ve ever done.

---

## Add 3–5 Projects

Pick your best and most recent projects.  
Include personal, school, or bootcamp projects that show:

- Technical skills
- Problem-solving ability
- Real-world usefulness

Each project should have:

- A short one-line description
- Tech stack (React, Node.js, etc.)
- GitHub or live demo link

---

## Add 1–2 Experiences

Even if you’re new to tech, include experiences that show teamwork, consistency, or leadership.  
For example: freelance work, internships, or even part-time jobs with transferable skills.

Each experience should have:

- Your title and company
- Timeline (e.g., Jan 2024 – Jun 2024)
- 2–4 bullet points about what you achieved

---

## Write Strong Bullet Points

Use **action verbs** like _Built, Designed, Improved, Led, Automated, Deployed._  
Keep each point short, specific, and outcome-driven.

Example:

- Built a responsive e-commerce site using React and Tailwind CSS.
- Improved page speed by 35% through code optimization.

---

## Use ChatGPT to Check Your Resume

Copy and paste your entire resume into ChatGPT and use this prompt:

```
"Please review my resume for ATS compliance and share any feedback or updates I need to make."
```

---

If your resume scores **94 or higher**, you’re in a great spot.  
If not, review the suggestions and update accordingly.

## Final Advice

Clean layout.  
Strong verbs.  
Short sentences.  
Real results.

That’s how you stand out — even as a junior.
