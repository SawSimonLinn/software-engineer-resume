# Simon’s LaTeX Resume Template

Hey there, I’m **Saw Simon Linn**, and this is the LaTeX resume template I personally use and customize on [Overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com).  
If you want a clean, modern, and developer-friendly resume that actually looks like you know what you’re doing — this one’s for you.

Why I Use LaTeX

I switched to LaTeX because I wanted my resume to look sharp, clean, and consistent every single time — no broken formatting, no shifting layouts.
It’s perfect for developers and designers who care about structure and detail.

That’s it.
You now have a professional, simple, and elegant resume — built the same way I make mine.
Clean. Confident. No nonsense.
